D's Developer Dotcommands

Some simple commands I use to help me develop.
Best taken with https://github.com/StalePixels/SPUI

.INI - Command-line INI editor for simple, programmable edits to INI or INI style config files.

.EVERY - Job scheduler.  Manages named jobs and will set NextRex 0x7F if the schedule is due.

.UNTAR - POSIX compliant ESXDOS version of UNTAR, super easy to embed in other apps.

.CH8SHOW - View 768b/1k 1bit font files in ROM/UDG format inspired by Damien Guard's zx-origins project.

.INKEY - View keycodes as returned for keys & combos from z88dk built for lazy developers who need a handy guide.

.LESS - Less is more. A plain text pager with extra features, a compliment, not replacement, for MORE  - thanks Marco.
